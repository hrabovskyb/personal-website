						<h3 id="project-1">Imagine RIT 2015: RIT Meets The Jetsons</h3>
			            <h4>Role: Project Lead</h4>
			            <!--p>Each year, RIT hosts a creativity festival, <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/" target="_blank">Imagine RIT</a>, where students can showcase the work that they have been doing throughout the academic year. With each new year President Bill Destler issues a challenge competition to the students. In 2015, the challenge involved using the AR.Drone 2.0 by Parrot to complete two sets of tasks. The first set included manually piloting the drone and capturing images of pre-defined targets. The second asked students to program their provided quadcopter to complete an autonomous task (as decided by the teams). A full description of the competition and rules can be found <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/contests-jetsons.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			            <p>For the manual control portion of the competition we controlled the quadcopter from a laptop using a custom program that utilized a currently existing node.js library. For the autonomous portion we attempted to have the quadcopter catch a ball that was thrown by one of our members by calculating where the ball was going to land and moving to that location. The application for this task leveraged an openCV program written for color tracking. A camera on the laptop tracked the drone and the ball and would send commands to the drone depending on its location relative to where it had calculated the ball would land.</p>
			            <p>As project lead it was my responsibility to drive the team, cosisting of 4 additional Mechanical Engineering students, towards our goal and to delegate the various programming and testing tasks. The biggest challenge was learning the various programming languages that were used to complete the challenge. Unfortunately, after all the work, our quadcopter was unable to successfully complete the autonomous task on the day of the competititon. This was due to the fact that there was an incredible amount of visual noise that the camera saw. Since the execution of our task relied on color tracking, it made it impossible for our program to get accurate data from only the quadcopter and the ball.</p-->
