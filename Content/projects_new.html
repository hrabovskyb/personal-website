			            <p>As a member of the RIT Aero Design club I have had the opportunity to work on many different practical application projects, from designing and building remote controled airplanes to side projects to increase productivity in the lab. Below are a few of the projects that I have worked on, either as a part of a team or an individual.</p>

          						<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

								<h4>ImagineRIT 2016: Wind Tunnel</h4>

								<img src="Media/windTunnelScaled.png" class="aeroPimage">
								<p>A small scale wind tunnel was made to showcase the basics of aerodynamic flow across an airplane for Imagine RIT in 2016. </p>
								<p>The walls are made from cardboard with a plexiglass test section for visual purposes. Air is pulled through a flow straightener by 4 120mm computer fans. Theoretical speeds of approximately 8 m/s are acheived in the test section of the tunnel.</p>
								<p>Air flow is visualized by injecting the byproduct of a dry ice and water reaction downstream of the flow straightener</p>

								<h4>Spring 2016: DC Power Supply</h4>
								<h5>Role: Individual Project</h5>
								<img src="Media/powerSupplyIndex.png" class="aeroPimage">
								<p>When the power supply used to charge batteries malfunctioned, a new one was needed rapidly. An old computer power supply was converted into a bench top power supply and is currently used to charge the club's battery packs.</p>
								<p>The conversion allowed for a quick solution while not costing the club any money. It can also be used for any other applications requiring a DC power supply, as long as the requirements are within the specs of the supply.</p>
