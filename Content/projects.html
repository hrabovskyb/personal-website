          						<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

          						<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

          						<h3>Computer Power Supply Conversion</h3>
          						<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

			            <p>Each year, RIT hosts a creativity festival, <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/" target="_blank">Imagine RIT</a>, where students can showcase the work that they have been doing throughout the academic year. With each new year President Bill Destler issues a challenge competition to the students. In 2015, the challenge involved using the AR.Drone 2.0 by Parrot to complete two sets of tasks. The first set included manually piloting the drone and capturing images of pre-defined targets. The second asked students to program their provided quadcopter to complete an autonomous task (as decided by the teams). A full description of the competition and rules can be found <a href="http://www.rit.edu/imagine/contests-jetsons.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			            <p>For the manual control portion of the competition we controlled the quadcopter from a laptop using a custom program that utilized a currently existing node.js library. For the autonomous portion we attempted to have the quadcopter catch a ball that was thrown by one of our members by calculating where the ball was going to land and moving to that location. The application for this task leveraged an openCV program written for color tracking. A camera on the laptop tracked the drone and the ball and would send commands to the drone depending on its location relative to where it had calculated the ball would land.</p>
			            <p>As project lead it was my responsibility to drive the team, cosisting of 4 additional Mechanical Engineering students, towards our goal and to delegate the various programming and testing tasks. The biggest challenge was learning the various programming languages that were used to complete the challenge. Unfortunately, after all the work, our quadcopter was unable to successfully complete the autonomous task on the day of the competititon. This was due to the fact that there was an incredible amount of visual noise that the camera saw. Since the execution of our task relied on color tracking, it made it impossible for our program to get accurate data from only the quadcopter and the ball.</p>

			            <p> This project began as a personal endeavor into the hobby of remote controlled multi-rotor platforms. There are many off-the-shelf quadcopters that can be purchased, but I was interested in designing my own frame and choosing my own electronic components. There were various reivisions of the frame, each one (except for the final revision) being designed in either Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks. Most of the parts were then cut on a laser cutter. A commercial frame was purchased for the final revision.</p>
			            <p>The project of building the platform began with the final goal of creating my own control system for flying. Once the platform was created I began to get interested in aerial photography using multi-rotors. In the future I do plan on finishing the control system and implementing a camera gimbal and camera to the bottom of the platform.
